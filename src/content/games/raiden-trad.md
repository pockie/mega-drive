**Raiden Trad**, known as Raiden Densetsu (雷電伝説) in Japan, is a 1991 shoot-'em-up published by Micronet for the Sega Mega Drive exclusively in the US and Japan. It is an expanded port of Seibu Kaihatsu's 1990 arcade shoot-'em-up Raiden and the only game in their Raiden series of shoot-'em-ups on a Sega console.

A European release was planned by Ubisoft but it did not materialise.
