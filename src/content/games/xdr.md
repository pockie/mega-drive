**XDR** (エックス・ディー・アール) (X-Dazedly-Ray[4]) is a Sega Mega Drive horizontal shoot-'em-up developed by Affect and published by UNIPACC. Released exclusively in Japan in August 1990, the game is notable for being one of the poorest received Mega Drive games ever released, and was frequently voted the system's worst Japanese-developed game by readers of Beep! MegaDrive magazine.
