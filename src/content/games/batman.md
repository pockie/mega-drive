**Batman** is a video game developed by Sunsoft and released for the Sega Mega Drive in 1990. It was inspired by the 1989 Tim Burton-directed Batman film. The game is more faithful to the film's plot than the NES game of the same name and includes levels in which the player controls Batman's vehicles.
