**Michael Jackson's Moonwalker** is a Sega Mega Drive action platform game developed by Sega CS and published by Sega. Based on the titular 1988 film Michael Jackson's Moonwalker and starring world-famous pop music artist Michael Jackson, it was first released in August 1990 as one of the system's earliest big-name titles. It later received a relatively faithful Sega Master System port early the following year by developer Arc.

Moonwalker, alongside its arcade counterpart of the same name, is notable for being one of the earliest uses of direct celebrity endorsement in video game production, and marks the very beginning of Jackson's long and storied collaboration with Sega.
