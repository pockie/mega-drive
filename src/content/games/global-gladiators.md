Mick & Mack as the **Global Gladiators**, called just Global Gladiators in Europe and Brazil, is a run-and-gun platformer by Virgin Games for the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Master System. The Sega Game Gear version was also meant to be released in North America in July 1993[16] but was cancelled for unknown reasons.

The game is a McDonald's licensed game with an environmental theme, with the protagonists fighting enemies and machinery that represent pollution. It was also one of the first games to have a dark-skinned protagonist.
