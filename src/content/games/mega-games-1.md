**Mega Games I**, released as Triple Score: 3 Games in 1 in the United States, is a compilation initially released for the Sega Mega Drive in Europe in 1992. It was the first of three similar compilations, being followed by Mega Games 2 and Mega Games 3. The North American version shows World Championship Soccer on the packaging, although World Cup Italia '90 is included on the cartridge instead.
