**Herzog Zwei** (ヘルツォーク・ツヴァイ) is a strategy video game developed by Technosoft, released exclusively for the Sega Mega Drive in 1989, and a sequel to Herzog, which was only released for Japanese home computers in 1988. It was published in Japan by Technosoft in 1989 and in North America and Europe by Sega in 1990.

**Herzog Zwei** is often credited for creating the foundations of the RTS (real-time strategy) and MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) genres as we know them today. It was also a precursor to the hero shooter genre, as it was the first game to combine shooter and MOBA elements.

In 2013, a spiritual sequel called AirMech Delta was published by Ubisoft.
