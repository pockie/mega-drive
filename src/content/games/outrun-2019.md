**OutRun 2019** (アウトラン 2019) is a Mega Drive/Genesis-only pseudo-sequel to Out Run that takes place in the future. The object is to race against a time limit in a rocket-boosted car across four different stages around the world. Like the original Out Run, there is a fork in the road before each checkpoint; however, there can also be forks within a single route.
