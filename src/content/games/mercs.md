**Mercs**, called Senjou no Ookami II (戦場の狼II) in Japan, is a top-down arcade shoot-'em-up developed by Capcom, which was ported to a variety of home consoles and computers including the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Master System. It is a sequel to the arcade game Commando (Senjou no Ookami in Japan) and was followed by Wolf of the Battlefield: Commando 3 in 2008.

The Mega Drive version of Mercs was banned from sale in Germany.
