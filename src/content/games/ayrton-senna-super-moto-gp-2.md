**Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II** is an arcade-style Formula One racing video game developed and manufactured by Sega for the Sega Genesis and Mega Drive, Master System, and the Game Gear in 1992. It is a follow-up to Super Monaco GP. The game was also endorsed by, and had technical input from, the then-Formula One champion Ayrton Senna. Gameplay includes a World Championship season featuring recreations of the tracks in the 1991 Formula One World Championship, along with a three-race "Senna GP" mode set on fictional tracks.
