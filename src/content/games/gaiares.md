**Gaiares** (ガイアレス, Gaiaresu) is a horizontally scrolling shooter developed by Telenet Japan and published by Renovation for the Sega Genesis in Japan and North America in 1990. It was one of the first 8Mb cartridge games on the Genesis. Its title combined Gaia (Mother Earth) and the suffix "less" (Res), as the Earth has been lost to pollution in the far future according to the game's plot (thus making mankind "Earthless").
