**Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium** is a role-playing video game developed and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis. It was released in Japan in 1993 and Europe and North America in 1995. It is the fourth and final game in the original Phantasy Star series, concluding the story of the Algol Star System. Phantasy Star IV kept many of the gameplay elements of the previous game, including turn-based battles, overhead exploration, and magic spells. It received mixed reviews upon its release, but has since been subject to much more positive retrospectives, and it is considered one of the greatest video games of all time. The game was also released for the Wii Virtual Console in 2008, and the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack in 2021, and has also been included in various Sega emulated collections.
