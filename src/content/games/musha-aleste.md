**Musha Aleste**: Fullmetal Fighter Ellinor (武者アレスタ), known in the US as M.U.S.H.A.: Metallic Uniframe Super Hybrid Armor, is a 1990 shoot-'em-up developed by Compile for the Sega Mega Drive. It was published in Japan by Toaplan and in the US by Seismic. There was no European release.

The game shares its basic mechanics with previous Aleste games but drastically reinvents the setting with the player piloting a large flying mecha in futuristic environments evoking feudal Japan. The word "musha" (武者) means "warrior" or "samurai" and signifies this aesthetic.
