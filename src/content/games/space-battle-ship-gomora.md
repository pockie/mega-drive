**Bio-ship Paladin**, known in Japan as **Space Battleship Gomora** (宇宙戦艦ゴモラ, Uchū Senkan Gomora), is a 1990 horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up arcade game. It was later ported to the Sega Mega Drive. While the game is essentially a standard horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up, it has an innovation that makes it unique in the genre. The player flies a spaceship (specifically, a bioship) which has the standard forward guns to be found in all horizontal scrollers, but it also possesses a weapon that can be manually targeted with a crosshair, in the same manner as in the game Missile Command. This allows the player to fire in any direction with pinpoint accuracy, and adds an extra level of strategy to the game. The game saw an almost arcade perfect port on the Sega Mega Drive. What few changes there were actually enhanced the look of the game such as added parallax scrolling backgrounds in level 2. It would eventually see a re-release after quite some time as part of the Arcade Archives series for Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 on August 5th, 2021 worldwide.
